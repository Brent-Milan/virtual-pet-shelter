Virtual Pet Shelter
Week 3 Project
Brent Milan

There are three classes interacting on this project:

VirtualPet - holds attributes, constructors, and methods for the VirtualPet class.

VirtualPetShelter - houses Hashmap<> to store VirtualPet objects and corresponding methods that affect all objects or key/values in map.

VirtualPetShelterApp - runs the program, calls methods/constructors from other classes, and provides console input/output to user.

Objective: maintain the health of all pets at a dubiously operated pet shelter. You can feed, water, play with, clean, admit, and adopt homeless pets.

If their attributes get out of hand (60 or above), the game ends.

Please note that the "hygiene" attribute functions differently. Pets start at int 10 hygiene and this decreases over time. Keep those pets clean!
